### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jonathan Calixto and I'm a fullstack software engineer. I have extensive experience using React and Redux.js in the front-end and Ruby on Rails and Mongoose/MongoDB in the back-end. I have experience creating and implementing a multitude of different technologies such as PostgreSQL, Express, JQuery, Node.js and many others. 

I recently finished a 1000+ hour bootcamp at App Academy, a full-stack web development course with less than 3% acceptance rate where I spent over 80 hours week studying and perfecting my skills in different technologies.

During my free time, I i like to spend it playing video games, catching up on my favorite shows and spending time with my family and friends. I'm a big fan of reading and an even bigger fan of robotics and new technologies. 

Feel free to shoot me an email at calixto_jonathan@ymail.com
